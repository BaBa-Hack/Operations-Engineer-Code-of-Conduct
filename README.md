## Bonus Rule
Every **3 months** we will have a profit distribution. The distribution of every person will depend on the task you have done in this period.  
* Every individual share will defined by :   **(Personal task done) / (task of the whole team done in the period) * 100%**  
* **Personal task : Tasks are weighted based on the time required for completion, the difficulty of the task, and the contribution of the task to the project. (Range : {0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1} )** 
****
For example : In the last 3 month there is 10 task done , and a person have done 3 task , they are weighted 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 . The total profit share of the team is 1000 USD . Then he got : (0.25 * 1 + 0.5 * 1 + 0.75 * 1)/10 * 100% = 15% * 1000 USD = 150 USD
